# space-stack-adm

The purpose of this repo is to create all necessary resources to provide an entry point for a developer team aka Pipeline. 
The definition of such Pipeline can also be stated as LandingZone - where security and compliance requirements are already baked in.

This repo creates:
 - a GitHub repo (to be used by dev)
 - some GitHub Actions to secure and govern the IaC upstream
 - a Mondoo Space to register the assets
